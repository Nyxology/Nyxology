Well, hello there! The name's Nyxology.

You ca call me Josh, though. I am a semi proffessional
multimedia producer, and I am in love with the gaming
world. I utilize the Unreal Engine to familiarize myself
with the coding language of C++, as well as give myself
a place to create all of my gaming projects, animations,
and assets on.

If you wish to contact me, you can email me here.
